# Exoglossic-Government-and-Internet-Usage

Is Internet usage lower in countries with Exoglossic Government working languages (lingua franca)?

Two places we can expect to see this is South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

* exoglossic government language leads to less content in your language
* it could mean the venecular language is never formalised it terms of vocabulary and spelling
* South Asia uses different scripts (between gov and ven, but also from ven to ven)

There are some places in with very high levels of Internet penetration where this can also be tested.

* Switzerland: Swiss German (no formal spelling) vs. French and Italian (same as in respective countries)
